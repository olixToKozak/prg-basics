#Write a program that converts a decimal number into a binary number. To convert a decimal number to binary, follow these steps:
#Read a decimal number from the keyboard.
#Divide the number by 2 and note the remainder.
#Divide the quotient obtained by 2 and note the remainder.
#Repeat the same process till we get 0 as the quotient.
#Write the values of all the remainders starting from the bottom to the top. That will be the required binary number.
#Sample result:

#Enter decimal number: 12
#12(10) = 1100(2)

dec=int(input('Enter a decimal numner: '))
number=dec
bin=""
while number > 0:
    reminder = number % 2
    bin = str(reminder)+bin
    number = number // 2

print(f'Binary number:{bin}')
